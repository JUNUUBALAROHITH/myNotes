Notes App is a web application in which users can create new notes, read, update, delete existing notes (CRUD Operations) in the local system. I used node js for running a web server in a local system and express js framework to route the application. MongoDB is my database which will store all information of notes and do CRUD operations. Data can be seen by other users which is much used in team works. It also helps to maintain a daily activities list and make users remember easily by this user can organise him/his daily activities perfectly.
